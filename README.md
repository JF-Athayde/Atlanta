# Atlanta
Documents recently found by researchers show that the Audience Hall of the Royal Palace in the lost city of Atlanta was tiled with 20 cm x 20 cm tiles. Two colors of tiles were used: the center of the Hall was tiled with white, and exactly one row of blue tiles was placed on each side of the Hall, as in the figures below.

Researchers have not found any trace of the Audience Hall (or the city of Atlanta!), but recent documents, if authentic, also indicate the number of tiles used in the Hall's floor.

Your task is to determine the dimensions of the Audience Hall, given the quantities of blue and white tiles.

# Input

The first line of the input contains an integer AA, the number of blue tiles. The second line contains an integer BB, the number of white tiles.

# Output

Your program should output a single line, containing two integers, representing the dimensions of the Hall (width and length). If the width is different from the length, your program should print the smallest dimension first, followed by the largest. If the number of pieces is not correct to build the floor of the room in the format described above, your program should print "-1 -1".

# 1≤ A ≤1061≤ A ≤106
# 1≤ B ≤1061≤ B ≤10
